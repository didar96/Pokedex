1. Look up pokemon by name
2. Look up pokemon by number
3. Loop up a list of all pokemon belonging to a certain type

When looking up pokemon by name or number, your Pokedex will display the following information about the pokemon:
1. Pokemon name

This program is designed to fetch data from a CSV file, connect to a MySQLite database and create tables to store all the information and then dispaly to the user.

To run this program simply copy the code in your IDE and run the pokedex.py file. Also be sure to download the CSV file.
